# Cursor Landing Page Clone

This project is a pixel-perfect recreation of the [Cursor.com](https://cursor.com) landing page, built using HTML and CSS. It features a custom-designed SDK window interface, responsive layout, and modern web design elements.

## Features

- **Custom SDK Interface**: A fully coded, interactive-looking code editor window built with HTML/CSS (no static screenshots).
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes (though primarily optimized for desktop).
- **Modern Styling**: Uses CSS variables for consistent theming (Dark Mode), glassmorphism effects, and animations.
- **Asset Integration**: includes custom feature illustrations and company logos.
- **Clean Code Structure**: Semantic HTML and organized CSS.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure.
- `style.css`: All conflicting styles and layout rules.
- `assets/`: Directory containing images and SVGs.
