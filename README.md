## Cursor Clone Project

Hey there! 👋 This is my attempt at cloning the Cursor landing page. It's a cool little project where I'm trying to replicate the design and layout using HTML and CSS.

### What's inside?
You'll find `index.html` for the main structure and `style.css` for all the visual jazz. Plus, there's an `assets` folder packed with all the images and icons used in the design.

### How to check it out
Super easy! You can either open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
Or you can chck it on https://cursor-clone.nitishkumar.cloud/

That's it!

Hope you like it! �
