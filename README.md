# 🎨 Recreating the Cursor Landing Page

Hey there! 👋 

This project is my personal take on recreating the stunning [Cursor.com](https://cursor.com) landing page. I've always admired their clean, developer-focused aesthetic, so I decided to challenge myself to build it from scratch using just HTML and CSS.

It's not just a copy-paste job—it's a deep dive into modern web design.

## ✨ What's Inside?

- **Hand-Coded "SDK" Interface**: Instead of using a screenshot for the main hero image, I coded the entire editor window using HTML and CSS. It's fully inspectable and sharp on any display.
- **Pixel-Obsessed Layout**: I spent a lot of time tweaking margins, fonts, and colors to get it *just right*.
- **Dark Mode Goodness**: Built with a sleek, dark theme that's easy on the eyes, using CSS variables for easy tweaking.
- **Responsive-ish**: It looks great on desktop (where we spend most of our time!), and I've added some touches to make it behave well on smaller screens too.

## 🛠️ How I Built It

I kept it simple and effective:
- **HTML5** for the semantic structure.
- **CSS3** for all the styling magic (Flexbox, Grid, gradients, and glassmorphism).
- **Google Fonts (Inter)** because typography matters.

## 🚀 Run It Locally

Want to poke around the code?

1.  Clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/StarkNitish/cursor_clone.git
    ```
2.  Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
3.  That's it! No build steps, no `npm install`—just pure web goodness.

## 🙌 A Note

This project is for educational purposes and is a tribute to the design team at Cursor. All rights to the original branding and design concepts belong to them. I just wanted to see if I could build it!

Happy coding! 🚀
